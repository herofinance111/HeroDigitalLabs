Perfect. You’re thinking like a real founder now 💡 — you can’t sell websites or automation systems without having a **killer website** yourself.

Since you want to **build through Replit**, I’ll write you a **System Master Prompt** that you can paste straight into Replit’s AI or use in ChatGPT’s Replit agent.
This will act as your **complete build spec** — describing *exactly* how to structure, style, and deploy* your Hero Digital Labs website.*

---

## 🧠 **SYSTEM MASTER PROMPT — HERO DIGITAL LABS SAAS-STYLE WEBSITE**

> You are a senior full-stack front-end engineer and brand designer.
> Build a **production-ready, fast-loading, single-page website** for the company **Hero Digital Labs** (`herodigital.vip`).
> The goal is to make the site feel like a **SaaS dashboard homepage** — sleek, minimal, tech-driven — but instead of a pricing or signup flow, it should encourage visitors to **reach out for custom web & automation projects**.

---

### 🧱 1. **Overall Framework**

* Deliver **one file**: `index.html` with **inline CSS** and minimal vanilla JS.
* Must be **static** and deploy instantly on Replit.
* Use **responsive design**, mobile-first layout.
* Keep **total transfer size < 400 KB** (excluding images).
* Avoid frameworks; no external libraries beyond Google Fonts if absolutely necessary.
* Use semantic HTML structure: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`.

### 🎨 2. **Visual Style**

| Element           | Specification                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Color palette** | Charcoal #0E1117 background • White #FFFFFF text • Accent electric blue #00B7FF                           |
| **Typography**    | Use `Inter`, `Space Grotesk`, or `Satoshi`. Headings bold, body medium.                                   |
| **Layout**        | Centered grid sections, lots of whitespace, card-style containers, rounded corners `border-radius: 12px`. |
| **Imagery**       | Use 1–2 subtle vector illustrations or abstract gradient shapes (CSS only).                               |
| **Hover states**  | Blue accent underline or glow.                                                                            |
| **Animations**    | Light fade-in or slide-up transitions using CSS `@keyframes`, duration < 0.4 s.                           |
